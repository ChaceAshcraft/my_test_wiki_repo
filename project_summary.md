```
Getting ready for bed at a regular time
Is one of the most important habits you can learn
David has probably never stopped to think what a wonderful thing sleep is
Dreams are normal too
Going to bed at a regular time each night
Makes it easier to go right off to sleep

Rest your head, here's a lullaby
A melody for heavy eyes
Early to bed, early to die
Welcome to your worst nightmare
Fast asleep, it's all in your head now
Past the street where they cursed my name
But I won't be forsaken
Craven my revenge from the shallow grave
Where I went down in flames
The beast has been awakened
When night comes creeping
My cruel hand will rock you to sleep
I'm the American nightmare
With American dreams
Of countin' the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare
Yeah, I'm living' the dream
I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream
Sweet dreams
Fell in love with hate 'cause evil fit like a glove
It's fate that I'm still here
And I won't be forsaken
Wicked when I was just a man
But sickening now and fed by fear
The beast has been awakened now
They all think it's just pretend
You'll never ever sleep again
All your friends are ******* dead
You can't turn down your own deathbed
When night comes creeping
My cruel hand will rock you to sleep
I'm the American nightmare
With American dreams
Of countin' the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare
Yeah, I'm living the dream
I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream
I'm the American nightmare
I'm the man of the dreams
Now the cloth is cut
So I'm sinking my claws in the silver scream
One, two, dreams do come true
Three, four, see you at the morgue
Five, six, he'll get his fix
Seven, eight, now shake the twisted hand of fate
No!
Now shake the twisted hand of fate
All your friends are ******* dead
When night comes creeping
My cruel hand will rock you to sleep
I'm the American nightmare
With American dreams
Of countin' the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare
Yeah, I'm living the dream
I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream
I'm the American nightmare
I'm the man of your dreams
Now the cloth is cut
So I'm sinking my claws in the silver scream

Note that I enclosed the lyrics in a script block. This is typically used to enclose code blocks, like the following:

```python
def function():
    print("hello world!")

function()
```

I just used it because I copy and pasted from the internet, which had newline calls at the end of each line of the lyrics. Since markdown requires two newlines to register a newline in the website format, all of it read as one line, which I did not like. This was a simple fix, although I'm not sure it was the correct one.
